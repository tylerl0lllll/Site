The other day I watched the movie Perfect Blue for the first time. The movie was fantastic all the way through, but something about that title screen just fascinates me. Easily my favorite part.

The way cham comes out on stage, how the music starts so suddenly and fades aways just as fast to show the words "Perfect Blue"; I just love it so much. 

Anyways, first blog post and didn't know what to write about so just thought I'd share. Cheers!
